# colorsjs.io/isValid

Lifts portions of code from colorjs.io npm package that was private so we could expose add an isValid function. I have submitted 
a [Pull Request](https://github.com/color-js/color.js/pull/633) to [colorjs](https://nextjs.org/) to add this feature. In the meantime, 
this extension does the job until it's approved and merged.
